# Part 2 - Plotting and control

In this part we will draw graphics using a plotting technique.
This means plotting points along a defined function.
A function can for instance be a sine wave, a circle, or as complex you want it to be.

We will use different methods for controlling the function parameters, using mouse and keyboard input, and a simple graphical UI.

After this part you will have a basic understanding of the following:
* How to plot points along lines, circles, and self defined functions.
* How to plot point alone the _superformula_ function.
* How to make a simple GUI to control parameters of functions.
* How to color the points with static, gradient, and random colors.
* How to offset the points using noise.
