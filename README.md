# nannou-workshop-trondheim

This is the repo for the [Rust Trondheim](https://www.meetup.com/rust-trondheim/) workshop in graphics programming with the [Nannou](https://nannou.cc/) library.

## Welcome!
Welcome to a workshop about The Rust programming language, where we use the graphics library Nannou to draw simple graphics programs to a window.

Rust is familiar to many of you here, but here at Rust Trondheim we strive for an open and inclusive environment for learning, on all skill levels, so much of the workshop material is geared towards people that haven't used Rust that much before.
The graphics library Nannou is comparable to tools like Processing, p5.js, openFrameworks etc., meaning that it should be relatively easy to get up and running with playing around with graphics.
Due to this, the graphics material included in the workshop is not very complex.

## Trajectories
Based on feedback from the previous meetups I have tried to set up the sequence of the parts in such a way that you can skip the parts that don't interest you, or you already know a lot about.
The goal is that we get more time to read, run, modify code examples using Nannou, and bring up recurring and common questions along the way.

I can propose three different trajectories that you can choose from:

- Go through the parts linearly, starting with `p0`
  - This option is probably nice for people quite new to either Rust or Nannou
  - There are also some material in this material aimed more the more experienced users.
- Check out the examples for nannou:
  - Maybe a good trajectory if you already are well acquainted with graphics programming, and you are more interested in looking at Nannou specifically.
  - You can optionally skim through the material in this repo first, and then go on to the examples.
- Go through the official Nannou guide:
  - A good alternative to the material in this workshop, as admittedly this workshop is a work-in-progress.
  - The official guide to Nannou does bring a wide overview, but it can be said that neither the community nor the documentation for Nannou is comparable to Processing.

## Nannou official examples and guide
In the [Nannou repo](https://github.com/nannou-org/nannou) there are three sections with examples that you may want to check out:
* [Basic examples](https://github.com/nannou-org/nannou/tree/master/examples)
  * More technically oriented examples, showing the nuts and bolts at play.
  * Divided into thematic chapters
  * You can run an example with e.g. `cargo run --example draw`
* [Nature of Code examples](https://github.com/nannou-org/nannou/tree/master/nature_of_code)
  * Many have probably heard of Daniel Shiffmans [Nature of Code](https://natureofcode.com/). The examples is this directory are the same material ported to Rust.
  * You can run an example with e.g. `cargo run --example 4_03_particle_system_type`
* [Generative Design](https://github.com/nannou-org/nannou/tree/master/generative_design)
  * Code from [Generative Design](http://www.generative-gestaltung.de/2/) ported to rust.
  * You can run an example with e.g. `cargo run --example m_1_5_02`

The official Nannou guide is found [here](https://guide.nannou.cc/)

## My goal
The main goal is to have nice time together and talking about Rust, graphics programming and everything else.
A secondary goal is to have a look around the Nannou documentation, as that it may not that straight forward to figure out how the different APIs in the Nannou library work.

## Feedback

Feedback in any shape, form, medium or sentiment is appreciated.
We are continually to learn how to improve these meetups, so we are grateful for any help we can get.

If you want to participate by giving a presentation, workshop or demonstration, please contact us on the Discord of Rust Trondeim.

Pull request for corrections, typos, additions and similar is also welcome.
As mentioned, this workshop is a work-in-progress, which I am hoping to make into a series of articles further down the line.
So even though the material is at an early stage, comment at this stage are esepcially helpful.
