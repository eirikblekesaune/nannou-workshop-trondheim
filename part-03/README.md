# Part 3 - Movement vectors and flow fields

In this part we will look at using vectors as forces for moving objects.
We will use these vectors to affect the movement of an objects itself and nearby objects.
Then we will look at a technique called _flow fields_, where static vectors are placed in a grid, only acting to push moveing objects in specific directions.

After this part you will have a basic understanding of the following:
* How to use vectors to control the relative movement of objects.
* How to use the sum of vectors to simulate gravitational forces, and make a _boids_ type simulation.
